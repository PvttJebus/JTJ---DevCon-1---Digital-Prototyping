- Grappling Hook (Prototyped Mechanic)
-- The Grappling Hook mechanic would allow players to grapple on surfaces to pull themselves forward at high speed, making the traversal in our game faster and exciting. Players could also use the Grappling hook mechanic to pull lighter or smaller objects towards them

## Objective Statement
**Purpose:** Test the effectiveness of a grappling hook mechanic in creating a sense of exciting movement within the shrunken game world.

**Questions:**

**Experience of Use:** Does the grappling hook mechanic add a sensation of speed and agility? Does it feel responsive? 

**Interaction with environment:** How does the grappling hook interact with the world? Does the mechanic provide opportunities for engaging experiences and interactions within the game?

**Impact on Object Weight:** How does the functionality of the grappling hook change when object weight is taken into account? Does weight consideration positively or negatively affect the sensation of the mechanic?

## Design Rational

**Experience Vision:** 
Our vision focuses on a game featuring a battery-powered Grapple Hero action figure called "Zen Skye." Players will guide this action figure as it explores a household, seeking to understand why it is the only conscious toy among others. Along the way, players must maintain battery power by finding or recharging batteries. As the name suggests, the grappling hook will be the core mechanic for traversing the map. However, it will also serve as a tool for interacting with the environment, allowing for more unique environmental puzzles and possibly combat. This prototype is experimental, focusing on whether the grappling hook mechanic enhances traversal speed, introduces unique environmental puzzles, or possibly makes combat more exciting and allows players to utilize the grappling hook in many creative ways.
